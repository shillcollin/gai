Contributing to gai

Project Status
- We are currently in a docs‑first phase. Implementation will follow Phase 1 of the build plan.

How to Help Now
- Open issues for doc typos, gaps, or questions.
- Propose PRs that improve clarity, fix broken cross‑links, or add examples/fixtures.

Style
- Prefer concise, actionable sections. Use code fences with language hints (`go`, `ts`, `json`, `bash`).
- Keep provider/model names clearly marked as indicative where they may drift over time.

License & CLA
- We will select a project license before merging code contributions (MIT or Apache‑2.0 proposed). No CLA is required at this time.
